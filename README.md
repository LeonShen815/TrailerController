# Car-Trailer System Controller
Python project to display and control a trailer going backwards

# Prerequisites
This script uses Python 2.7. No other Python versions have been tested so far.

# Instructions
To run the simulation script, type:
```
./simulate.exe
````

This script allows the user to easily change the parameters of the system. To do so, you can create an input file with some custom parameters and upload them to the program by using the following command-line argument:
```
./simulate.exe -f path_to_input_file/file.inp
```
You can find an example of an appropriate input file in inputs/example.inp
